<h2>With Omron/Adept MobileRobots</h2>

<p>MobileRobots was a business unit of <a href="https://automation.omron.com/en/us/products/category/robotics">Omron Automation</a> (previously owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omron_Adept">Adept Technology</a>) specializing in providing hardware and software platforms
used for education and advanced research in mobile robotics.    An archive of the website featuring photos and information on the products
is availabe via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171221114232/http://www.mobilerobots.com/Mobile_Robots.aspx">The Internet Archive</a>.
Customizable systems were sold to research universities, institutes, government agencies and private enterprises around the world, and provided
with comprehensive software libraries and highly regarded personalized customer support.  Omron Industrial Automation closed this business unit and discontinued support
for all its products in 2018.

<h3>AriaCoda</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://github.com/reedhedges/AriaCoda">AriaCoda</a> is a fork of the ARIA open source (GPL) library (from Omron/Adept MobileRobots)  Some of the many improvements made include analyzing and testing the code to find and fix bugs, modernizing parts of the C++ codebase to C++17, optimizing a key LIDAR data processing component, removing obscolete code, overall optimization (especially reducing memory allocation and copying).  Code that was only used internally by Adept/Omron was removed. (The ARIA library was used both internally for Omron Automation's industral mobile robot products, and provided directly to research customers as a development SDK.)  A simple continuous integration job was added to perform test builds with various compilers and platforms. (ARIA has never had automatable unit tests; I have added a few but not many yet.)
Some bug fixes and improvements have been done to support users previously using ARIA or who are using ROS with MobileRobots hardware platforms.

<p><a href="http://github.com/reedhedges/AMRISim">AMRISim</a> is a fork of the open source (GPL) MobileSim mobile robot simulator (from Omron/Adept MobileRobots). I have made various improvements such as adding infrastructure to support multiple interfaces and adding a new ROS interface in addition to the existing Pioneer/ARIA interface, modernizing and optimizing parts of the C++ code, analyzing, testing and fixing bugs and assisting AMRISim users. (Upgrading to GTK4 was also planned but not yet started.)

<h3>User Documentation</h3>
<p>At MobileRobots I led several initiatives to improve, expand and polish customer documentation and manuals.
<ul>
<li>I ensured that C++ library APIs used by customers were comprehensively and accurately documented with consistent, clear API documentation (using Doxygen to generate documentation), that example programs were useful and easy to understand, and wrote various tutorials and knowlege base articles published on the support website.
<li>I updated and modernized the existing product user manuals. I added information and diagrams and fixed issues based on customer support feedback.
<li>I co-authored manuals for two new products including introductory explanations, all reference information, diagrams, schematics and step-by-step instructions, and safety information.
<li>I helped create the manual for a new product variant by adapting an existing manual, making accurate changes and adapting scope of information included to fit target market.
<li>Led the creation of a library of modular short guides for each optional accessory available for products, with key information, quick start guide and links to additional documentation.
<li>Helped create and later led the maintainaince of a comprehensive online knowlege base of information and infrastructure for distributing above documentation along with software releases and updates.
<li>Worked closely with MobileRobots customer support, hardware engineering, production/assembly, and marketing departments, and Omron/Adept technical documentation and other departments.
<li>Worked with customer support staff to moderate and administer user discussion lists (specific related to development software). 
<li>Covered for customer support staff on hardware customer problems when neccesary, expanded knowlege of hardware aspects of products.
<li>Customer documentation was created using Doxygen (API docs), MS Word, Madcap Flare, and ReStructured Text (product manuals and accessory guides), and customized MediaWiki installation (knowlege base and document/software distribution support site.)

<h3>Map Viewer</h3>
<h4>In Development</h4>
<a href="ss-mapview-explained.png">

<img src="ss-mapview-topo.png" width="273" height="508" />

<p>Map and nautical chart viewer with GPS tracking, implemented in C++ and QML/Javascript using Qt 6.x for both Mobile and Desktop use. 
Intended to be simple and easy to use while hiking, sailing, boating, or for small scale map annotation or geolocated field data collection etc.</p>

<p>Tools used include C++20, CMake, Conan, GDAL, catch2, Qt6, QtCreator, git, Android Studio, Android NDK</p>

<h5>Implemented:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Load and display maps and charts in various raster file formats including GeoTIFF or BSB (KAP) files.
<li>Read GPS data and automatically move map image to track position (current location is shown near bottom of view; map moves relative to screen and this position as you move).
<li>Temporary zoom in/out or set zoom.
<li>Use GPS position history to calculate course over ground (averaged direction of travel).  Automatically rotate map view to orient to current course over ground, show course line and bearing. 
<li>Automatically determine magnetic compass declination (magnetic variance). 
<li>Select destination waypoint from list with one click. Highlight destination waypoint on map, display bearing line to destination, angle
and distance.
<li>Load waypoints from GPX file.
<li>Convert and display headings and bearings in degrees relative to both true and magnetic north.
<li>Display various data (from GPS/mobile device sensors, and calculated by app) in resizable grid view.
<li>Partial test coverage of some data and navigation calculations, geographic projection,  data logging and other utility classes.
<li>Runs on Android and Linux Desktop.
<li>Optionally record all data received and calculated to a CSV data log file. 
</ul>

<h5>In Progress:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Easy to understand settings UI.
<li>Additional test coverage.
<li>Windows Desktop version. 
<li>Additional data calculations such as VMG, True Wind, etc.
<li>Use computed true wind direction to compute sailing laylines to waypoint and visualize on map view.
<li>Read GPS data from network (wifi/ethernet) and Bluetooth interfaces.
<li>Support additional map file formats (GeoPDF, GeoPNG, GeoJPEG, KML/KMZ with overlay,  etc.)
<li>Record past track as you move. Save to GPX file. Include positions and any other data selected.
<li>Improve UI elements: choosing map file(s), viewing/editing waypoints, choosing preferences etc.
<li>Visualization of GPS position accuracy.
</ul>

<h5>Future Ideas:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Tools to follow route (a sequence of waypoints)
<li>iOS and MacOS versions.
<li>"Bare" embedded version for OEM devices.  (QNX, VxWorks and other platforms supported by Qt are also possible.)
<li>Split screen and other additional features on larger size devices (Desktop, tablets.) 
<li>Sync data between devices (e.g. Desktop to mobile.)
<li>Visualization of wind, tide and current, manual approach/guide lines related to specific points. 
<li>Display AIS data if available via NMEA
<li>Other features useful for sail boat/yacht racing and cruising.
<li>Support for vector map data.  
<li>Simplified visualization of elevation, slope and other terrain information
<li>Data collection tools such as photos, interconnection with other apps, field notes, etc.
<li>... plus many more ideas.
</ul>
