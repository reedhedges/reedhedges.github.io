        Unfortunately, some other device support code I wrote was in separate non-open source libraries and is no longer

      </li>
      <li>From <a href="https://github.com/reedhedges/AMRISim">AMRISim</a> (see below for description of AMRISim):
        <ul>
          <li>The code that emulates the protocol used on real robots and manages the state of a client connection session is in
            <a href="https://github.com/reedhedges/AMRISim/blob/master/EmulatePioneer.hh">EmulatePioneer.hh</a> and  
            <a href="https://github.com/reedhedges/AMRISim/blob/master/EmulatePioneer.cc">EmulatePioneer.cc</a>.
            This code was "clean-room" reverse-engineered from documentation, robot and client implementations (the actual 
            robot firmware implementation was proprietary).  This code mostly conforms to what was the conventional C++
            code style at Adept MobileRobots at the time, which was largely based on C++03 and C++11, but does include
            some minor modernatizations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Originally, EmulatePioneer was the only client interface, but I later added
            <a href="https://github.com/reedhedges/AMRISim/blob/master/ROS1Node.hh">ROS1Node.hh</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/reedhedges/AMRISim/blob/master/ROS1Node.cc">ROS1Node.cc</a> which
            implement both a client interface for AMRISim and a ROS1 "node".

      <h3>AriaCoda</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="http://github.com/reedhedges/AriaCoda">AriaCoda</a> is a fork of the ARIA open source (GPL) library
        (from Omron/Adept MobileRobots). Some of the many improvements made over the original ARIA code include
        analyzing and testing the code to find and fix bugs, modernizing parts of the C++ codebase (still conforms to
        C++14, however, for compatibility with old compilers sometimes required by users) and refactoring buggy or
        unsafe implementations of API functions, optimizing a key LIDAR data processing component, removing obsolete
        code, overall optimization (especially reducing memory allocation and copying). All warnings and errors revealed
        by adding extra compilation warning flags and enabling address and UB sanitizers have now been resolved (plus
        issues indicated by tools such as clang-tidy and cppcheck). Code that was only used internally by Adept/Omron
        was removed. (The ARIA library was used both internally for Omron Automation's industral mobile robot products,
        and provided directly to research customers as a development SDK.) A simple continuous integration job was added
        to perform test builds with various compilers and platforms. (ARIA has never had automatable unit tests; I have
        added a few but not many yet.)
        Some bug fixes and improvements have been done to support users previously using ARIA or who are using ROS with
        MobileRobots hardware platforms.

      <h3>AMRISim</h3>


      <p>
        <a href="http://github.com/reedhedges/AMRISim">AMRISim</a> is a fork of the open source (GPL) MobileSim mobile
        robot simulator (from Omron/Adept MobileRobots). I have made a couple of improvements such as adding
        infrastructure to support additional client interfaces and adding a new ROS interface in addition to the
        existing Pioneer/ARIA interface (this allows users to use ARIA, AriaCoda, or ROS1 libraries in their own
        application code to easily choose, at runtime, to connect that application code to either a real robot or
        AMRISim via either ARIA, AriaCoda, or ROS), modernizing and optimizing parts of the C++ code (most of it
        is still C++11 style, and still retains the old Omron/Adept MobileRobots coding style), analyzing, testing
        and fixing bugs (both in AMRISim itself and in C code in the "Stage" simulation engine it is built around). Upgrading from
        GTK2.x to GTK4 was also planned but not yet started.

    <h2>With Omron/Adept MobileRobots</h2>

    <p>MobileRobots was a business unit of <a href="https://automation.omron.com/en/us/products/category/robotics">Omron
        Automation</a> (previously owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omron_Adept">Adept Technology</a>)
      specializing in providing hardware and software platforms
      used for education and advanced research in mobile robotics. An archive of the website featuring photos and
      information on the products
      is availabe via <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171221114232/http://www.mobilerobots.com/Mobile_Robots.aspx">The Internet
        Archive</a>.
      Customizable systems were sold to research universities, institutes, government agencies and private enterprises
      around the world, and provided
      with comprehensive software libraries and highly regarded personalized customer support. Omron Industrial
      Automation closed this business unit and discontinued support
      for all its products in 2018.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>ARIA</h3>
      <p>ARIA was the core library used to integrate mobile robotic systems
        and implement applications with Omron/Adept MobileRobots platforms.
        It was used internally to help implement the core robotics application
        (configurable autonomous mobile robot motion and behavior.) and provided
        to R&amp;D customers as an SDK to help develop their own applications.
        It provided a C++ API for controlling the mobile robot and its components, and
        for receiving data from the mobile robot and various sensors. It also
        provided utilities and building blocks generally useful in robotics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Development of ARIA was begun around 2003, and so over the years retained many
        legacy attributes of older C++ code. Later, some of this (but not all) was
        improved upon in my AriaCoda fork (see above).
    </div>


    <div class="project">
      <h3>MobileSim</h3>
      <p>MobileSim was an abstract simulator for multiple mobile robots in
        a two dimensional environment. Simulated sensors returned realistic sensor
        data based on the simulated robot's position with respect to walls and other
        obstacles defined in the environment, and the robot moved in the environment
        when commanded similar to the real robot (using parameters provided using the same configuration files used in
        ARIA).</p>

      <p>MobileSim included its own implementation of the same interface protocol that
        applications (via ARIA) used to communicate with a real robot platform.
        ARIA automatically detects whether MobileSim (or later, AMRISim) is running
        and simply uses the simulator's TCP port instead of the real robot's serial
        port. MobileSim included my own "clean room" re-implementation of the interface,
        since it was released as open source code, with compatibility verified through testing. MobileSim also extended
        this protocol with additional features.
      </p>

      <p>See also my AMRISim fork of MobileSim, described above.</p>

      <h3>ROS and Gazebo support</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS (Robot Operating System)</a> is
        an open source project that around 2010 began to emerge as a popular
        framework for robotic software development in academia, especially for mobile
        robots. Therefore it eventually became an important ecosystem to support
        and participate in. (This is something I and some other engineers
        identified and began discussions about within MobileRobots.) I did
        this by partnering with customers at the University of Zagreb, Croatia,
        who had already begun developing <a href="https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria">a ROS package to support our
          products</a>.
        I improved the documentation, including a detailed tutorial, and contributed some fixed and feature
        improvements; later, when the original maintainers had moved on, I took over maintainence
        of the package, managing contributions from some users and answering questions.
        One project performed by summer college interns whom I supervised, was to test and improve our ROS support with
        features, example code, as they designed and constructed their own ROS-based application.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also created <a href="https://github.com/MobileRobots/amr-ros-config">a package of configuration support</a>
        which could be used by MobileRobots product users, including 3D graphical models and physical parameter
        definitions (URDF files) of the various MobileRobots products which could be used
        by other ROS components and by the Gazebo simulator (which features 3D space
        and game-like physical interaction simulation.) I did this by combining originar engineering CAD information, my
        own design, and physical testing to verify various parameters.
      </p>

      <p>Finally, I also created <a href="https://github.com/MobileRobots/ros-arnl">a ROS component</a> that provided a
        high level API
        for interacting with our robust, proprietary, autonomous nagivation implementation,
        so that users could incorporate that into their ROS-based system design as well.

      <h3>Misc Device Support</h3>
      <p>
        As part of our highly customizable mobile robot products, we would frequently integrate third party devices such
        as sensors and actuators. I was responsible, along with an electrical/mechanical systems integration engineer,
        for evaluation of potential third party integrations, and if a product was chosen for integration, determine the
        appropriate level (i.e. my time and effort) for initial software support, and plan for any future development.
        (Sometimes, only a few third party device units would end up sold, while some would become popular and frequent
        additions to a customer system.)
      </p>

      <p>For some devices, I created a C++ wrapper library with improved, easy to use API around the vendor-supplied C
        library or example code, or around other available open source libraries or Linux driver interfaces (with
        instructions on how to install and configure required Linux and/or Windows drivers, libraries, etc.). For
        others, I
        simply implemented the device communications protocol according to documentation/specification, and included it
        in ARIA (e.g. GPS receivers via NMEA protocol) or in a separate support library. (When similar ARIA integrations
        were done by other Adept/MobileRobots developers, I would sometimes contribute documentation, examples and
        tests.) Or sometimes, I created a fork of a third party open source library with minor fixes, example code,
        documentation, or improvements for easier use by our customers.</p>

      <p>A few examples using open source code can be found at <a
          href="https://github.com/MobileRobots">https://github.com/MobileRobots</a>. Some others were not released as
        open source code and are no longer available.</p>

      <h3>Demos</h3>

      <p>I would occasionally create a product demo to display at trade conferences.
        The most recent demo featured a robot with two manipulator arms, and a Microsoft XBox Kinect sensor mounted on a
        pan/tilt unit. In the demo, the mobile robot would autonomously drive a route around the exhibition floor
        (avoiding people and other obstacles) using Omron/Adept's autonomous navigation implementation. When it returned
        to our table, it would stop and move the manipulator arms (in a predetermined sequence). Monitoring software
        running on a laptop (connected to the robot over wifi) showed the position of the robot, and visualization of
        sensor data including point cloud of obstacles detected by lidar, filtered point cloud derived by processing the
        Kinect depth data, and remotely fetched video stream showing RGB and depthmap data from the Kinect as images
        (using OpenCV to convert the image formats). Remote control, configuration and monitoring of system performance
        data was also possible. (Some of the code used in this demo can be found at <a
          href="https://github.com/MobileRobots/pioneer-lx-manipulator-demo">pioneer-lx-manipulator-demo</a> and <a
          href="https://github.com/MobileRobots/KinectArVideoServer">KinectArVideoServer</a>. This was implemented in
        the robot as a distributed system on two computers, one lower power computer performing autonomous control of
        the robot, and a second computer with a basic GPU capable of doing some of the Kinect depth map processing, and
        control of the manipulator arms.
      </p>

      <p>This robot configuration was sold as a special package, in which I assisted in overall design, as well as
        putting together documentation and example configuration (e.g. Linux network configuration, example ROS
        configuration, etc.)

      <p>At MobileRobots I led several initiatives to improve, expand and polish customer documentation and manuals.
      <ul>
        <li>I ensured that C++ library APIs used by customers were comprehensively and accurately documented with
          consistent, clear API documentation (using Doxygen to generate documentation), that example programs were
          useful and easy to understand, and wrote various tutorials and knowlege base articles published on the support
          website.
        <li>I updated and modernized the existing product user manuals. I added information and diagrams and fixed
          issues based on customer support feedback.
        <li>I co-authored manuals for two new products including introductory explanations, all reference information,
          diagrams, schematics and step-by-step instructions, and safety information.
        <li>I helped create the manual for a new product variant by adapting an existing manual, making accurate changes
          and adapting scope of information included to fit target market.
        <li>Led the creation of a library of modular short guides for each optional accessory available for products,
          with key information, quick start guide and links to additional documentation.
        <li>Helped create and later led the maintainaince of a comprehensive online knowlege base of information and
          infrastructure for distributing above documentation along with software releases and updates. (Based on
          MediaWiki with some customizations, e.g. to automate page changes as part of software package release
          workflow.)
          A partial archive of this site is available at
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180214114520/http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/Main_Page">The
            Internet Archive</a>. Topics in this knowlege based ranged from answers to frequently asked questions,
          step-by-step tutorials and guides for certain tasks, how to troubleshoot common software, computer OS and
          eletrical problems, how to configure Windows or Linux to work with various hardware devices, technical details
          of the robot hardware and electronic features, archives of all current and past manuals for robots and third
          party devices, pages from which users could download our software packages, and third party software and
          drivers, news, links to join email discussion lists, and a form to contact technical support.
        <li>Worked closely with MobileRobots customer support, hardware engineering, production/assembly, and marketing
          departments, and Omron/Adept technical documentation and other departments.
        <li>Worked with customer support staff to moderate and administer user discussion lists (specific related to
          development software).
        <li>Covered for customer support staff on hardware customer problems when neccesary, expanded knowlege of
          hardware aspects of products.
        <li>Customer documentation was created using Doxygen (API docs), MS Word, Madcap Flare, and ReStructured Text
          (product manuals and accessory guides), and customized MediaWiki installation (knowlege base and
          document/software distribution support site.)
      </ul>
